# DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

The **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle emphasizes the importance of reducing redundancy in code. The idea is that each piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, unambiguous representation in the system. By following this principle, developers can create systems that are easier to maintain and evolve by avoiding the need to make updates in multiple locations.

## Definition

- **Definition**: "Don't Repeat Yourself" â€“ Every piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, unambiguous representation in the system.
- **Purpose**: The DRY principle promotes the idea of reducing duplication in code, making systems easier to maintain, less error-prone, and more modular. Redundant code leads to bugs, inconsistencies, and increased maintenance costs, so avoiding repetition ensures that a system is easier to change and extend over time.

## Problem it Solves

- Repeating the same code logic in different parts of an application leads to issues such as:
  - **Bugs**: When you need to fix an issue, you have to fix it everywhere the logic is duplicated, which is error-prone.
  - **Inconsistencies**: If the same logic is modified in one place but not in others, it can lead to inconsistent behavior.
  - **Difficulty in maintenance**: Having duplicate code in multiple places makes it harder to update or change the logic.

## Solution

The DRY principle encourages you to:

- **Abstract common logic** into reusable methods or functions.
- **Utilize inheritance or interfaces** to share behavior across different classes.
- **Use design patterns** such as **Factory**, **Strategy**, or **Observer** to handle repeated functionality in a generalized way.

## Benefits

- **Cleaner code**: Reducing redundancy leads to cleaner, more readable code.
- **Easier maintenance**: Modifying the logic in one place automatically propagates the change, reducing the chance of introducing bugs.
- **Improved reusability**: Code that is abstracted into reusable components can be used across different parts of the system.
- **Faster development**: With less repetitive code, developers can work more efficiently and with fewer errors.
