# Architecture Design Review (ADR) Document: Onboarding KEDA and Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

---

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose:
This document outlines the architectural review for onboarding KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) and Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to our existing Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) environment. This initiative aims to improve the scalability, performance, and resource efficiency of key services within the bank’s core infrastructure.

### Scope:  
The implementation of KEDA and HPA will enhance our ability to dynamically scale services based on load and event-driven triggers, particularly to accommodate high throughput, heavy database load, and large volumes in Azure Service Bus queues. The scope includes:
- Integrating KEDA for event-driven scaling.
- Leveraging HPA for traditional load-based scaling.
- Ensuring the seamless integration with our existing AKS deployment, which powers critical bank applications.

## 2. Service Overview

### KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling):
KEDA is an open-source project that allows Kubernetes workloads to scale based on external events or custom metrics. KEDA integrates with event sources such as Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage, and others, which will be crucial for scaling services triggered by high volumes in message queues.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):
HPA automatically adjusts the number of pods in a deployment based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics. By integrating HPA with KEDA, we can create a more granular, responsive scaling mechanism, scaling pods dynamically based on demand for CPU, memory, or queue length.

### Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS):
This will be the environment in which both KEDA and HPA are deployed and managed. AKS will continue to be the container orchestration service running the bank’s microservices and applications.

## 3. Effort to Implement

### Technical Requirements:
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Existing AKS cluster needs to be updated to support KEDA and HPA.
  - Integration with Azure Service Bus and database monitoring tools for event-driven scaling.
- **Software**:
  - KEDA controller needs to be installed and configured within the AKS environment.
  - HPA configurations will need to be updated for the new event-driven autoscaling.
  - Custom metrics server needs to be deployed to allow horizontal scaling based on additional application-specific metrics.
- **Automation and CI/CD**:
  - Update deployment pipelines to automate KEDA and HPA configurations.
  - Add monitoring and alerting to ensure that autoscaling events are properly tracked and responded to.

### Integration Steps:
1. Set up KEDA in the AKS environment.
2. Configure KEDA to scale based on Azure Service Bus and database load metrics.
3. Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for non-event-driven services with CPU and memory-based scaling.
4. Integrate KEDA with existing application metrics and define scaling policies.
5. Conduct stress testing and performance benchmarking to validate scaling accuracy.
6. Update the monitoring tools (e.g., Azure Monitor, Prometheus) to track scaling events.

### Timeline:  
- **Week 1-2**: Environment setup, install KEDA, configure AKS for scaling.
- **Week 3**: Implement event-driven scaling logic, integrate Service Bus and custom metrics.
- **Week 4-5**: Testing, monitoring, and refinement.
- **Week 6**: Final integration and deployment.

## 4. Business Benefits

### Scalability:
The integration of KEDA and HPA will allow our bank’s services to scale efficiently in response to both traditional load-based metrics (CPU, memory) and event-driven triggers (e.g., message queue length). This will enable us to handle spikes in transaction volume or processing load without manual intervention, ensuring our services can meet customer demand at all times.

### Cost Efficiency:
By dynamically scaling based on actual demand, KEDA and HPA will ensure that we are only using the resources we need, significantly reducing wasteful over-provisioning of compute resources. This leads to better cost management and operational efficiency, especially during low-demand periods.

### Performance:
The ability to automatically adjust resources will improve performance under variable loads, reducing latency in service responses and database interactions. It will also help prevent service degradation under heavy loads, improving customer experience and operational reliability.

### Operational Efficiency:
Automating scaling reduces manual intervention and monitoring overhead, enabling the operations team to focus on higher-level tasks. This aligns with our goals of increasing agility and reducing operational complexity.

## 5. Security Review

### Security Considerations:
- **Access Control**: Ensure proper identity and access management (IAM) policies are in place for KEDA and HPA controllers to interact with Azure resources such as Service Bus, Storage, and databases.
- **Event Source Security**: KEDA will interact with external services like Azure Service Bus and databases. These services must be secured with Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, managed identities, and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized services and users can trigger scaling.
- **Pod Security**: Ensure that Kubernetes namespaces, RBAC roles, and pod security policies are implemented to prevent unauthorized access or escalation of privileges within the AKS environment.
- **Data Security**: Ensure that sensitive data processed during scaling events (e.g., data from Service Bus or databases) is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Use managed identities for Azure resources to restrict access.
- Implement a zero-trust security model within the AKS environment.
- Regularly review and rotate credentials, tokens, and other sensitive information.
- Conduct vulnerability assessments on KEDA, HPA, and AKS configurations.

### Compliance:
The implementation of KEDA and HPA will adhere to the bank’s internal security policies, as well as regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR). Data handled by the scaling mechanism, especially customer data, will be encrypted and stored in compliance with relevant regulations.

## 6. Integration with Existing Services

### Impact Analysis:
- The implementation of KEDA and HPA will introduce minimal disruption to existing services. The scaling behavior will be additive and will not impact current deployments unless scaling limits are reached.
- There may be slight changes to service deployment configurations (e.g., adding HPA specifications, configuring KEDA triggers) which will require coordination with development teams.

### Dependencies:
- The integration with Azure Service Bus and other external systems requires ensuring proper network configurations, authentication, and monitoring.
- Application-level support for metrics collection and scaling triggers is essential for KEDA to function correctly.

### Testing Plan:
- **Load Testing**: Simulate high throughput scenarios with Azure Service Bus and database load to test the scaling behaviors of KEDA and HPA.
- **Integration Testing**: Verify that services scale correctly and that all event-driven triggers function as expected.
- **Failover and Resilience Testing**: Ensure that services remain resilient under failure conditions (e.g., loss of event source or database outage).

## 7. Risks and Contingencies

### Risk Assessment:
- **Over-Scaling**: If misconfigured, HPA could trigger unnecessary scaling, leading to resource wastage.
- **Under-Scaling**: KEDA may not scale adequately in response to certain workloads, leading to service degradation.
- **Service Outages**: Network or configuration issues could cause delays in scaling, impacting service availability.

### Contingency Plans:
- Set up fallback mechanisms, such as horizontal scaling caps and alerting systems to prevent over-scaling.
- Establish clear thresholds for event-driven scaling triggers and ensure thorough testing before production deployment.

### Risk Mitigation:
- Implement detailed monitoring and alerting to quickly detect and correct scaling issues.
- Set up manual override controls for scaling actions during troubleshooting or emergency situations.

## 8. Conclusion

### Recommendations:  
We recommend proceeding with the implementation of KEDA and HPA to improve scalability, performance, and resource efficiency. This solution aligns with our strategy of automating and optimizing cloud-native infrastructure while ensuring security and compliance standards are met.

### Next Steps:  
- Obtain approval for the proposed architecture and implementation plan.
- Begin with a phased rollout, starting with non-critical workloads for testing.
- Monitor the performance post-deployment and refine configurations as necessary.
