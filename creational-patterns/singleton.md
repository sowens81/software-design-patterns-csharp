# Singleton Pattern

## Overview

The **Singleton** pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when you need a single shared resource across the application (e.g., a database connection or configuration manager).

## When to Use

- When only a single instance of a class is needed (e.g., a single configuration manager or logger).
- To ensure that the instance is created only once and provide a global access point to it.
- When instantiation of a class is resource-heavy and you want to avoid creating multiple instances.

## Problem it Solves

Without the Singleton pattern, you could end up creating multiple instances of a class that is supposed to be unique. This can lead to issues such as resource contention or excessive memory usage.

## Solution

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the class is created. It uses a static method or property to provide access to the instance and ensures that the object is created only when it's needed.

## C# Code Example

```
public class Singleton
{
    // Static instance of the class.
    private static Singleton _instance;

    // Private constructor ensures no instances are created from outside the class.
    private Singleton() { }

    // Public method to provide global access to the instance.
    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                _instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
    
    public void DisplayMessage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Singleton instance accessed.");
    }
}
```

## Visual Example

Imagine a logging system where you only want one logger instance to handle logging across the entire application. This ensures that all log messages are directed through the same logger instance, preventing multiple log files or inconsistent logging behaviors.

In this example:
- You create a **Logger Singleton** that handles the logging across your application. 
- Instead of creating multiple logger instances in different parts of the application, the **Singleton** pattern ensures that all parts of your application use the same logger instance.

For instance, a user authentication process, an error-handling system, and a user activity tracking system may all rely on a single logger instance to write messages to a single log file or database. Using Singleton ensures that the log entries are consistent and managed by a single point of access.

## Benefits

- **Global access**: The Singleton pattern provides a globally accessible instance.
- **Memory efficiency**: By creating only one instance, it minimizes memory usage for the object.
- **Lazy initialization**: The object is created when needed, not at the programâ€™s startup, helping to optimize resources.
