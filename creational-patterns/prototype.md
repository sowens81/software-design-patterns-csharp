# Prototype Pattern

## Overview

The **Prototype** pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, rather than creating a new instance from scratch. This pattern is particularly useful when object creation is resource-intensive.

## When to Use

- When object creation is expensive (e.g., complex setup or heavy resource usage).
- When you want to clone an object with the same state but avoid creating new instances from scratch.
- When you need to create a large number of similar objects and cloning them is more efficient.

## Problem it Solves

Without the Prototype pattern, creating new instances of an object might require complex and resource-heavy setup. Instead of repeatedly constructing objects, the Prototype pattern allows you to clone existing ones, saving time and resources.

## Solution

The Prototype pattern enables cloning of an existing object, which is typically a simpler and more efficient process than re-instantiating an object from scratch.

## C# Code Example

``` C#
public class Prototype
{
    public string Field { get; set; }

    // The Clone method uses MemberwiseClone to create a shallow copy.
    public Prototype Clone()
    {
        return (Prototype)this.MemberwiseClone();
    }
}
```

## Visual Example

In a game development scenario, cloning objects (e.g., characters, enemies) is faster than recreating them from scratch. You can simply copy the prototype of an object and adjust properties as needed (like changing position, stats, etc.).

For example, in a **strategy game**, you may want to clone a base unit to create new units with the same initial stats, avoiding redundant setup of new objects every time a new unit is created.

## Benefits

- **Efficient object creation**: Cloning objects can be more efficient than recreating them from scratch.
- **Consistency**: The cloned object will have the same state as the original, making the creation process easier.
